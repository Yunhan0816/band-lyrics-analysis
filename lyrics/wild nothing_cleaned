Dancer in the night
Playing with my eyes
Velvet tongue so sweet
Say anything you like
Crush me with the lie
And tell me once or twice
That love is paradise
That love is paradise
Amo

Amant
Amavi

Everything was love
Everything wil be love
Everything has been love
Everything would be love
Everything would have been love
Ahh...that was it. The truth at last
Everything would have been love
The huge eye which would have become an immense fear was gently breathing only without an eye, nor a sphere
But our great wonderful animal, covered in little waving legs like hairs
Waving, oh so gently as if they were underwater
All should be went and all should be well said that ocean
So the place of reconciliation existed after all
Not like a little, not wholly uncovered, but flowing everywhere and being everything
I had only to will it and I would be
For spirit is omnipotent, only I never knew it
And being able to walk on the Earth
I could forgive. I could be forgiven
I could forgive. Perhaps that was the whole of it after all
Perhaps being forgiven is just forgiving and no one had ever told me
There was nothing else needful
Just to forgive
Forgiving equals being forgiven
The secret of the universe
Do not whatever you do forget it
The past was folded out and in the twinkle of an eye and everything had been changed
And made beautiful and good
Oh, why is your hate so addicting
And I, well, I wonder where you've been
I don't see you often
I try to feel something for you
But that's all that I can do
Give my shadow to you
Do you ever see me at night
And does it please you at all
When you head up the wall
I'd go with you if you asked me to
But we wouldn't get too far
Two strangers in the dark
You wanna know me, well, what’s to know?
Do I amuse you, when the night is slow?
Do your eyelids ever close
Caught spirits in your waking woes?
I know where to find you, I know where you go
And I just want to let you know
You can have me, you can have me all
You can have me, you can have me all
And you’re twisted, what can I say?
Your days are empty and my tongue is decayed
And we stay up just to tempt me
One more night of your company
I know where to find you, I know where you go
And I just want to let you know
You can have me, you can have me all
Innocent love
I need someone somewhere
I need somewhere to come down
I need some way to make you smile
Innocent love
I need someone somewhere
I need somewhere to come down
I need some way to make you smile
We're not happy 'til we're running away
Clouds in your eyes
With nothing but the foggiest day
One of a kind
I need to keep you here
I need to picture you still
I need to clear the fog
One of a kind
I need to keep you here
I need to picture you still
I need to clear the fog
We're not happy 'til we're running away
Clouds in your eyes
With nothing but the foggiest day
Clouds in your eyes
We're not happy 'til we're running away
Clouds in your eyes
With nothing but the foggiest day
It's getting hard for me
To reframe all those shifting memories
Like a music box that
Never starts dancing by itself
What a broken world, what a broken world
But it's my own
Just to see you, to see through you
I step inside
Letting go, I want to be happier now
I want to be more than close
Surreal, the way you made me out
The way you crash me down
It's getting hard for me
To remember all of the names from my life
You've been so many
Different kinds of people in my mind
Letting go, I want to be happier now
I want to be more than close
Surreal, the way you made me out
Letting go, I want to be happier now
I want to be more than close
Surreal, the way you made me out
The way you crash me down
Letting go, I want to be happier now
I want to be more than close
Surreal, the way you made me out
Letting go, I want to be happier now
I want to be more than close
Surreal, the way you made me out
You speak in tongues I can't resist
You run me 'round I cannot think
We're driving to your parent's house just for a visit
And I'm sleeping in your brother's bed
Won't you sneak into my room and crawl under the covers
Talk nonsense in your sleep
You come unguarded once again
And I can't wait to let you in
We're driving to your parent's house just for a visit
And I'm sleeping in your brother's bed
Won't you sneak into my room and crawl under the covers
Talk nonsense in your sleep
You've got some charm I must admit
Don't let me wreck myself again
I'm driving to your parent's house just for a visit
And I'm sleeping in your brother's bed
Won't you sneak into my room and crawl under the covers
Talk nonsense in your sleep
Pull the blinds
All the black dreams I've had
Well they don't mean much now
When I rise at noon
I'm missing someone I don't know
And I don't want to be alone
And this house is now a grave
I've been sleeping here for days
I'm too hidden to awake
So i disappear always
Call someone up
Just to have a drink
We can talk about anything, I don't care
Getting out of the house
For an hour or two
But it's missing something I can't explain
And this house is now a grave
I've been sleeping here for days
I'm too hidden to awake
So i disappear always
You weigh on my mind
Like pieces of you stuck to me
And I needed time to be there
To feel myself move again
Whenever I want you
You are mine
Whenever you tell me
It's going to be fine
And I thought you were mine to be
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now
And I thought you were onto me
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now
In the mural room
Aligning the tapestry
Thousands of years spent
A missed opportunity
Whenever I want you
You are mine
Whenever you tell me
It's going to be fine
And I thought you were mine to be
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now
And I thought you were onto me
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now
Whenever I want you
You are mine
Whenever you tell me
It's going to be fine
And I thought you were mine to be
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now
And I thought you were onto me
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now
And I thought you were mine to be
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now
And I thought you were onto me
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now
Dressed in the moonlight and paler than bone
She has got something that I've never known
I couldn't explain it I won't even try
She is so lovely she makes me feel high
'Cause I'm with Heather
Yeah only Heather
Only Heather
Only Heather
Can make me feel this way
Misunderstood, yeah she's good I can tell
Though everyone tells me I'm under her spell
But I'll never leave her they don't know our deal
It's better to fake than to love her for real
'Cause I'm with Heather
Yeah only Heather
Only Heather
Only Heather
Can make me feel this way
Can make me feel this way
Can make me feel this way
Can make me feel this way
Wild heart surrender to me
What does it take to be like you?
Golden haze, hold out for days
Haven't seen you, haven't seen anyone
Beautiful one
I wanna know what you are
Beautiful one
I wanna go where you are
Wild heart surrender to me
What does it take to be like you?
Golden haze, hold out for days
Haven't seen you, haven't seen anyone
Beautiful one
I wanna know what you are
Beautiful one
I wanna go where you are
Sitting on the cigarette butt front porch
I could ask you "are you dead like me?"
Call me what you will, but call me again
It's true I don't talk too much
Because our lips won't last forever
And that's exactly why
I'd rather live in dreams and I'd rather die
Because our lips won't last forever
And that's exactly why
I'd rather live in dreams and I'd rather die
Pretty face could you make the jump with me?
I'm dying just to let things go
Do you remember the lightening storm?
It was the first time that I really felt you
Because our lips won't last forever
And that's exactly why
I'd rather live in dreams and I'd rather die
Because our lips won't last forever
And that's exactly why
I'd rather live in dreams and I'd rather die
We've got eyes on the back of our heads
We've got eyes on the back of our heads
We've got eyes on the back of our heads
We've got eyes on the back of our heads
I caught you in the dollhouse
Drinking coffee with your new wife
How is your new life?
Swiping through headlines
How do you find the time?
You two look very nice
Silver in your eyes
The synapse connecting
Red and open wide
Homelife in the wild
You're looking very nice
You're looking very nice
Now I'm obsessive
Walking through keyholes
Fixing picture frames
Letting the soil drain
I had a temper but now I'm delicate
I keep it to myself
I keep it to myself
Silver in your eyes
The synapse connecting
Red and open wide
Homelife in the wild
Partners in motion, beautiful devotion
Partners in motion, beautiful devotion
 you don't have to go)
Partners in motion, beautiful devotion
)
Partners in motion, beautiful devotion
Calming down with my head in the sand
Come away, come away
To begin, let's get closer
Doesn't he love me?
Just sit by the withered trees
Resting my knees
Because I'm losing comfort
Doesn't it feel right?
Mystical
When you're blowing your hair in the perfect waves
You're trying your best just to push me away
I can't ever tell since you were never there to begin
My angel in loneliness
My angel lonely
My angel in loneliness
My angel lonely
Passing by, I should have known
Let me slip into the tomb
White glow
Step in the white glow
Make me, make me
Grin and blush
Shining eyes are watching
Us too
And I'm assuming they are
Mystical
When you're blowing your hair in the perfect waves
You're trying your best just to push me away
I can't ever tell since you were never there to begin
My angel in loneliness
My angel lonely
My angel in loneliness
My angel lonely
I am the silent sun
I am the only one
I'd lift you up if I knew
How to do the things that I
Can I learn to wait for my life
The more I get the more that I
And yet the water flows on
Feet in the mud now they're
Sink into the ground to belong
The less you say the less that you get wrong
I'll try a new face for now
Trying this new face that I can't see
Don't get me wrong now
It all flows on
Don't get me wrong now
It all flows on
When I'm home
There is nothing I'm looking for
That you haven't already found
When I'm home
In the shallow water
You can swim around me
I won't mind
Circling me underneath
The only one I'll ever need
Eyes are moving in your sleep
And I wish I knew what you were watching
When everything goes quiet for a while
There's nothing left for us to reconcile
When everything goes quiet for a while
I'll meet you in the shallow water
I'm a fool
But at least you're foolish too
You're my crutch
But it's you that helps me to walk
Drowning in a coral sea
The only place I'll ever be
Eyes are moving in your sleep
And I wish I knew what you were watching
When everything goes quiet for a while
There's nothing left for us to reconcile
When everything goes quiet for a while
I'll meet you in the shallow water
Standing out by the station
Waiting for the clouds to part
It's been a very long time
You understand my frustration
And I can see the end in sight
But I can't see anyone I know
Not you, the one that I adore
Not you, my vibration
After all the dust has settled and you
Come walking out the dark into view
Only then, can I let her go
Only then, am I calm
So she sits on a stairwell
Her face in shadow like a dream
The whisper "Have you been here for long?"
"Oh no, don't worry."
When I look up she is another
Her figure stretched and torn apart
The echoes are bouncing round my brain
Within me, not far
After all the dust has settled and you
Come walking out the dark into view
Only then, can I let her go
Only then, am I calm
After all the dust has settled and you
Come walking out the dark into view
Only then, can I let her go
Only then, am I calm
Tomboy, my love
Wear me like a glove
You make feel like an alien
You make feel like an alien
We are dust above the Earth
Witnessing our birth
You make me feel like an alien
You make feel like an alien
You're so pretty
Where did you come from?
You're so pretty
Where did you come from?
Tomboy, my love
Wear me like a glove
You make feel like an alien
You make feel like an alien
We are dust above the Earth
Witnessing our birth
You make me feel like an alien
You make feel like an alien
On my own
She's at home
There's not a single day that I don't tell you "Miss you more"
Time in space
A love delayed
Just know that when I go there's no reason to be afraid
How can we want love?
How can we want love?
How can we want love?
Distance frays
Pulled away
But when the static comes there's nothing left for us to say
No words
The best words
I take a life of pause just so I can be near to you
How can we want love?
How can we want love?
How can we want love?
VERSE 1
You don't know, I've got nothing to say anymore
It's a shame I know, we're both perfectly in loathe
Lets not say you never give me anything
I don't care, I was what I was right there
CHORUS
Do I really need to tell you
That I've got a twisted twin soul for you
I've got a palm I'm reaching for you
Do I really need to tell you
That I've got a twisted twin soul for you
I've got a palm I'm reaching for you
VERSE 2
In your eyes, I've got nothing to see anymore
To convince me enough to compromise my heart
Let's not say its just a game again
Cause we both know we're both perfectly in loathe
CHORUS
Do I really need to tell you
That I've got a twisted twin soul for you
I've got a palm I'm reaching for you
Do I really need to tell you
That I've got a twisted soul for you
I've got a palm I'm reaching for you
In my head
You dance like curtains
In the wind
You're my burden
I can't feel your heart
I've been gone
I've been gone
I can't release these sighs
You won't hear
You won't know
You won't ever know
Harden your heart
It was falling from the start
Though I tried
I was always dead inside
Midnight song
Sing you to the moon
I am your quiet night
You were gone too soon
I can't feel your heart
I've been gone
I've been gone
I can't release these sighs
You won't hear
You won't know
Look away you paint me in
Sometimes I grow bolder
Funny how the moment comes
Closer still to know you
So you gave a quiet light
My one chance at order
I won't toss your way aside
For any corner of the world

There is no answer to the question
We are in mutual possession
This is the circle that we live in
These are the people that we've been
I know you're not an angel
You're just trying to be good
And deep down I am selfish
I know it to be true
And I don't believe in heaven
But maybe you can be my church
If you let me pay you a visit
I will lay down at your feet
And learn a woman's wisdom
And learn a woman's wisdom
And learn a woman's wisdom
Help me just to see it
The writing on the wall
For you there are no boundaries
You're a daughter of the world
And I don't believe in heaven
But maybe you can be my church
If you let me pay you a visit
I will lay down at your feet
And learn a woman's wisdom
And learn a woman's wisdom
And learn a woman's wisdom
And learn a woman's wisdom
And learn a woman's wisdom
And learn a woman's wisdom
How does that sound?
And how does that sound?
How does that sound?
And how does that sound?
Touch my face, wipe my cheek
Talk to her, go to sleep
Dream of nothing, wake up tired
Talk to no one, not today
I feel like drifting now
I’m going to drift into your eye
Touch my face, wipe my cheek
Talk to her, go to sleep
Dream of nothing, wake up tired
Talk to no one, not today
I feel like drifting now
I’m going to drift into your eye
The street light won't stop shining through the window
By the pullout couch where I've been sleeping
I don't know what you've been told, but I'm alright
You signed your name a million times in cursive
On the cover of every book you own
Miss me more, miss me less, I never know
Your parents kept on with the poems you wrote
When you were eight years old in the garage
I did too, and when I think of you, I'm like a child
The street light won't stop shining through the window
By the pullout couch where I've been sleeping
I don't care if I sleep again, it's okay
I know it's calling your bluff
What a beautiful confirmation
That I'm in the dark
Where I've always been
Why must we be so rough?
Is it the thing in the promise that keeps us?
Do you know what you want?
Fuck being perfect
Dream and love
Never wake up
Dream and love
Never wake up
I know it's calling your bluff
What a beautiful confirmation
That I'm in the dark
Where I've always been
Why must we be so rough?
Is it the thing in the promise that keeps us?
Do you know what you want?
Fuck being perfect
Dream and love
Never wake up
Dream and love
Never wake up
 
Sold myself for a shot at the moon
And I sold myself so I can be a big star
And I'll be your monkey every night
If it makes you love me, watch me now
Watch me, watch me
Is that the way? I never knew
Is that the way?
Is that the way? I never knew
I was a waste
I'm not a human, I'm just a body
Just a dancing shell here to make you happy
I have no feelings, I have no thoughts
I have to make you love me, watch me now
Watch me, watch me
Is that the way? I never knew
Is that the way?
Is that the way? I never knew
I was a waste
Is that the way? I never knew
Is that the way?
Is that the way? I never knew
I was a waste
Is that the way? I never knew
Is that the way?
Is that the way? I never knew
I was a waste
Boys don't cry, they just want to die
Stumbling, coughing, grin or lie
Will you look into my eyes?
Will you be my new dress?
Box up all of your things with tape
Write your address, hope it won't be late
Can I still be your pessimist?
Boys don't cry, they just want to die
Stumbling, coughing, grin or lie
Will you look into my eyes?
Will you be my new dress?
Wonderland of holy water
Another drink another dollar
Hand in hand
A sleeping skin
The man with no face
I bit my tongue
Now can you tell me if my cup is full
Will I find a way
To make sense of the way that you love me?
Will I find a way
To repay you for all that you've done for me?
Lady Blue
Lady in tears
Can we start, start to change with each one ourselves
You can't be sad for everyone
Another taste another question
Hand in hand
Will I find a way
To make sense of the way that you love me?
Will I find a way
To repay you for all that you've done for me?
Will I find a way
To make sense of the way that you love me?
Will I find a way
To repay you for all that you've done for me?
I wait!
Can you wait forever, girl?
"I can wait."
I wait!
Can you wait for-
I wait!
Can you wait forever, girl?
"I can wait."
I wait!
Can you wait for-
I wait!
Can you wait forever, girl?
"I can wait."
I wait!
Can you wait for-
I wait!
Can you wait forever, girl?
"I can wait."
I wait!
Can you wait for-
Lilac, I wish you were my little Lilac
O Lilac
I trust you can't remember most so rest your head now
Your head now
Lilac, I feel your last lies come straight from her eyes
To my eyes
Tonight, should you rise above, I regret love
I regret love
And you have ghost hands on, that can't hold you up
And you have ghost hands on, I can't hold you up
I gotta let you live
I gotta let you
I gotta let you live
I gotta let you
Lilac, I wish you were my little Lilac
My Lilac
I trust you can't remember most so rest your head now
Your head now
And you have ghost hands on that can't hold you up
And you have ghost hands on I can't hold you up
I can't hold you up
TV Queen.
Putting clothes on.
Her felt red dress and her stockings.
And when you walk out of that box,
and out of that screen, you're real to me.
No, that's not right.
I got so lost trying know you.
Trying to touch you. Trying to
No, that's not right.
I got so lost trying know you.
Trying to touch you. Trying to
In a bright room.
Is this your face?
Is this your body that I'm seeing?
Those dead eyes.
The closest I can ever get to you. The real you.
No, that's not right.
I got so lost trying know you.
Trying to touch you. Trying to
No, that's not right.
I got so lost trying know you.
Trying to touch you. Trying to
No, that's not right.

Trying to touch you. Trying to
No, that's not right.
I got so lost trying know you.
Trying to touch you. Trying to
