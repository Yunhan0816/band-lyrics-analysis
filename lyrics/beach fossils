Pardon me, I didn’t realize what’s in your eyes
My arms are open wide
But I can't ever decide what I wanna do

I’m staring at the sky
But I can’t tell which way my thoughts are traveling
I try to listen to your words
But I can’t feel my head and it’s unraveling

Sometimes I no longer know what it means
To care about the things you want to do
Everybody’s living or they're dead
And I’m still in my bed and I don’t have a clue

[Chorus]
I won’t lie and tell you it’s alright
I won’t lie and tell you it’s alright



[Verse 1]
I don't want your Wall Street
Don't got no degree
Written on the concrete
A-C-A-B
Couldn't really tell you
What I'm trying to find
Everyone's so boring
Makes me want to lose my mind

[Chorus]
So call me up tonight
If you need somewhere to get out of the light
These days I feel like I do nothing right
So come with me and we'll go down the line

[Verse 2]
I'm thinking of you fondly
When I'm on the train
I really hate your poetry
You hate mine the same

[Chorus]
So call me up tonight
If you need somewhere to get out of the light
These days I feel like I do nothing right
So come with me and we'll go down the line

[Outro]
These days I feel like I do nothing right
So come with me and we'll go down the line



[Verse 1]
Turn 'round in time to be on the other way
I know you're gonna try and bring me down
Run 'round my feet on the other way
Not gonna be in town when you're around

[Chorus]
No, I won't be there in time
No, I won't be there in time

[Verse 2]
This year I told myself it'd be a better one
Try not to fall back onto the knife
By now I told myself I'd be a better friend
I'll meet you on the other side of life

[Chorus]
No, I won't be there in time
No, I won't be there in time
No, I won't be there in time
No, I won't be there in time



So now you found the time to get away
But you don't know what to do about yourself
I see it but I look the other way
And I'm feeling like I'm falling out again

On the outside, on the outside
On the outside, change your mind
I'm feeling nothing, I'm feeling nothing
On the outside, change your mind

I'm lost in
I'm lost in
I'm lost in

So now you turn to me to get away
But you haven't figured out just what you want
You see those angels in the alleyway
Were they coming here to save me from myself?

On the outside, on the outside
On the outside, change your mind
I'm feeling nothing, I'm feeling nothing
On the outside, change your mind

I'm lost in the sugar
Found out you're the only one
I'm lost in the sugar
Found out you're the only one
Go on now forever
Found out you're the only one



[Verse 1]
If you find a reason
I'll be gone in a matter of time
This was your decision
Oh you got me in a state of mind

[Chorus]
I wish that there could be another way
But I know that you've made up your mind
You know there's nothing left for me to say
That could change your mind this time

[Verse 2]
How to find a reason
Television and another headline
Don't believe in Jesus
Heaven knows I'm wasting my time
Wanna believe in America
But it's somewhere I can't find

[Chorus]
I wish that there could be another way
But I know that you've made up your mind
You know there's nothing left for me to say
That could change your mind this time



[Verse 1]
Hustle in the five old years
Do you love and do you feel?
All your working inspiration
Systematic exploration
Words so great, words so real
Words so desperate and concealed
All your words are so poetic
Generational synthetic

[Chorus]
And I will do it on my own again
And I will say what I will
And I will do it on my own again
And I will say what I will

[Verse 2]
All my friends are far away
Leaves my head in disarray
I can't help but to forget
What is now and what is next
Trade a fortune for a soul
What we wanted all along
All your words are so magnetic
Generational apathetic

[Chorus]
And I will do it on my own again
And I will say what I will

[Chorus]
And I will do it on my own again
And I will say what I will
And I will do it on my own again
And I will say what I will



[Verse 1]
You say that you want me here
And I found the door
Then you open up my hand
Where you wanna go

[Chorus]
Can we start all our time over again
Can we start all our time over again

[Verse 2]
Make our way up to the roof
Been awake for days
In the shadow of the night
I wanna fade away

[Chorus]
Can we start all our time over again
Can we start all our time over again



The world is half asleep
And you’re just hanging on
To the friends that you keep
Out here on the road
Watch the land unfolding
Under my shadow

Sun goes down
Time goes on

Haaahahaaaahahaaaaaaaaaahaa
Haaahahaaaahaahaaaaaaaahaha
(x2)

You went out with the wind
Dreary as you can be
You know you're right in the end
Wherever you've been
I know that you can make it on your own, my friend

Sun goes down
Time goes on

Haaahahaaaahahaaaaaaaaaahaa
Haaahahaaaahaahaaaaaaaahaha
(x2)



I’m taking off again
It feels like it's so soon
Am I excited or am I just so confused
My head is numb and my hands are tied
And I can’t remember what it’s like
Get out of this place, going through
I’m taking off and I’m asking where are you
Where are you, where are you
Where are you
I can’t be found somewhere

Think of times I used to know you
Growing up, I thought about you
Trying not to see where are you taking me
Holding on to the truth

Where are you, where are you
I can’t be found somewhere, somewhere
I can’t be found somewhere, somewhere



[Verse 1]
And when the one on me you’ll see just where we go
And if you wanna have we’ll meet in vertigo

[Chorus]
Say something right as we go out into the night
Say something real, I wanna steal what we feel

[Verse 2]
Forgetting everything we’ll go and disappear
And if you go with me we'll swim right through the waves

[Chorus]
Say something right as we go out into the night
Say something real, I wanna steal what we feel



Life can be so vicious
That we can't even appreciate its purities
We get so excited
That we can't feel any of our insecurities
All of what you said
It went right over my head and now I’m gone
It feels like an attack
When I'm asking for it back, I know

[Chorus]
Dream, rebel, trust, youth, free, life, clash, truth
Real, time, gone through, peace, piss, shine, proof
Clash, truth, lush, you, lost time, so confused
Charge, train, hate, proof, nothing real, nothing true

[Chorus]



[Dustin Payseur:]
Our time together’s always blurry
After a while it’s all a story
And if you think you understand me
I guess you’re right it’s all I can be

[Rachel Goswell:]
I know all along
What I see
What I need
Nothing in between
Everything
Tangerine
Tangerine

[Dustin:]
Deep in the hours after midnight
Skating underneath the streetlight
Lie down together while we get high
Ride to the water for the sunrise

Uh uhuh uuuuh uhuuuhhhhhuh
Uh uhuh uuuuh uhuuuhhhhhuh

[Rachel:]
All I need
Tangerine
Tangerine
(x3)



All you got
All you got
Is never had nothing
You wish you had something

All you want
All you want
You always had something
You wish you had nothing

Gone to roam to get back home
Did you find devotion
Or were you just floating
Now so strong all along
I tell you don't rush it
'Cause you're never gonna trust it

Be nothing
Be nothing

Be nothing
Be nothing

[Bridge]

All you want
All you want
Is never had nothing

All you got
All you got
Is you always want something



[Verse]
I’m not upset when you’re around
I think I lose myself the second
That I see I’m found

[Chorus]
And not a day goes by or a moment without
Sometimes I can’t remember what I’m thinking about
Cause my head’s caught up and tangled in those dreams

[Verse]
I go up town on a quiet day
Just to gather my thoughts
When I don’t know what to say

And we go outside when the morning's dark
And we fall on the grass of an open park
And the sun will break when our heads hit the trees

And I’m on time though I didn’t try
And the seconds move slow
When the moments are too right

[Chorus]
And not a day goes by or a moment without
Sometimes I can’t remember what I’m thinking about
Cause my head’s caught up and tangled in those dreams

[Outro]
Daydream the days
Daydream the days
Daydream the days
Daydream the days



[Cities Aviv:]
05-05, you know
Trying to find the time
For you
You put me in a place somewhere between
Here, there and the true and living

Try to think about the past
Second to none I'm trying to
Make sense of this
And feel the way I feel about you
But still see the past for what it was

Just tell me, a part of me you kept
A part of me I swept away from you
I wish it’d mean as much to me as it used to, it don’t
I mean, honestly
Does that make sense to you, you know?
And that's what you said to me, so
Honestly, somewhere between trust and honesty
Out there somewhere between yourself
And the true and living
Rise up



Woken up and here I am
All too fast to understand
All the way across the sea
Thinking thoughts of you and me
In my life, I've never felt so free
You're so far away from me

What a pleasure all this is
I take it all the way
I take it all the way

I take it all the way
I take it all the way
I take it all the way
I take it all the way



It's new regret
Isn't it funny how we forget
It's too late for that
You're off on your own

Used to be up for anything
You were the highway star
[?] and of all of your spar

Keep moving on
Keep moving on

That's all for now

Nights that we forgot
Everyone won
But I woke up back again



It's so hazy
What you're breathing
Where you going
You're still dreaming

If they fall down
What will you say
But you don't care
These are your days



I'm crowded in the street
Feel like i'm floating on the air
Closer as we speak

I spent the morning here
I know you're somewhere over there
Closer everywhere

I hear your voice inside my head
Can't remember what you said
Oh no

In the city that you know
Can you ever take it slow?

Read all the magazines
I haven't shed a tear for weeks
Closer as we speak

They told the refugee
You know that nothing can be free
Closer everywhere

I hear your voice inside my head
Can't remember what you said
Oh no

In the city that you know
Can you ever take it slow?



Face it
I turn to you and I can face it
Us head first into the depths unseen
Lets me know that it's alright

Face it
I turn to you and I can face it
Us as one headed towards the darkness now
Lets me know that I'm fine

I'd give up the country life
I'd fall for you anytime
I'd give up the country life
I'd give up city life
I'd fall for you anytime
Anytime

Face it
You turn to me and you can face it
Us head first into the depths unseen
Lets you know that its alright

Face it
You turn to me and you can face it
Us as one head into the darkness now
Lets me know that I'm fine

I'd give up the country life
I'd fall for you anytime
I'd give up the country life
I'd give up city life
I'd fall for you anytime
Anytime



It's not so worth getting all bent out of shape about
I turn my back on it and next you know it's all run out
Do you wanna step outside or do you want me to ride
I don't know just what I feel but I feel it all tonight

I give it all in these hours that we set aside
I know I'm feeling brave but that's because my heart's untied
Don't want to trim anymore off of our only truth
We got enough to spare cause we're awake throughout our youth



I've been so lost inside my head
And are these really all my things

So what is happening to me
And does it gotta be so
Gotta be so
Gotta be so
Much that I can't see

And I hear you shouting down the street
But I couldn't go against my dreams

So if its carelessness we need
Well then it doesn't mean so
Doesn't mean so
Doesn't mean so
Much when it's just greed

Sometimes I'm hanging by the thread
Of all those memories I shed
I live my life with no regrets
I feel so careless in my head



Well I can understand
But I really don't care to know
And you can take my hand
But I don't care where we go
And if you think you know
What I'm thinking about
Then I can read your thoughts
Without any doubt
So we can go
Well let's go home

And if I happen to fall
Then please don't pick me up
Cause we're enjoying our time
And I wouldn't want to interrupt
They worked out so well
When you discovered that it's all the same
We get lost sometimes
But the reality will keep us sane

I know I think too much
I know I waste my time
And I can't figure out
Which one is yours or mine
That's fine
I really couldn't say I mind



Will you tear it down?
Will you decide?
We put up a fight for the other side
We raise up our arms to show we're strong
Then we break our bones, but we'll carry on

All that you see
Do you want to be
Adversity
All that you see
Do you want to be
You and me

Adversity

Oh, the clouds are moving in
Oh, we're all so new to this

All that you see
Do you want to be
Adversity
All that you see
Do you want to be
You and me

Adversity

All that you see
Adversity
All that you see
You and me

All that you see
Adversity
All that you see
You and me

Adversity



I couldn't talk to you
But I loved to walk with you
I drop from the sky
Right as you say goodbye
Forever have haunted our dreams

I lost my heart for you
And I set it free for two
Stones of the ground are coverin' lines
That I never once knew were there

The horse of you
The horse with your hands to the sky
We turn back again and I turn in my head now
The horse is no longer undone



I want too, away
I am too away

And when I say I go away
And I can't stay
I know I'm done, I'm done
And when you say stay awake and roll way
I know it's done, so done

I won't sit here
I won't be here
I won't take it
I won't break it
I won't sit here
I won't be here
I won't take it
I won't break it

Too away
I’m too away

I won't sit here
I won't sit here
I won't sit here, too



Are you waking me up now?
I was falling head first 'gainst the waves
It wasn't you that I could work around

And when they never get us set free
Then you're jealous, keeps reminding me
Oh there's no mistake here you're passing me, oh, oh

In the darkness passing through
Tell me is it really you?
You don't look the same
As when I was dreaming
Even though there's not much time
I can't get it off my mind
Everything feels different
Now here without you

Even though there's not much time
I can't get it off my mind
Everything feels different
Now here without you

Out in the way
Out in the way (It wasn't you that I could work around)
Out in the way (It was a rule that I could work around)



I don’t feel sorry for the things that I have done
I won’t be blaming everything is going wrong
And now you said it
And you’re finally feeling strong
But what I told you was the truth I’m all along

And in my head
I know I finally found a way
But now my time is off and I have no mistake
I’m beating my head on my hands
Beating my head on my hands

I don’t feel sorry for the things that I have done
I won’t be blaming everything is going wrong

Beating my head on my hands



Said I would love to bring you back
But I will take you anywhere
I find you trying hard to act
When everything’s up in the air

I walk with you across New York
We're on the bridge above the cars
We talk about how nice it is
That the city won’t care who you are



I can’t see a thing; well it’s on your face
I’m running down my stairs, and I’m heading to your place
Do you know what you have done to me?

We're spending all our time, it’s never felt so right
The sun lights the room , cause we talked all night
I could stay with you till the sun goes out

And I’m walking home, through the empty streets
I gave you a kiss, and you turned to me
I’ve never cared so much about anything before
It’s easy to lose track when you’ve lost your cares
Forget about my friends, and I know it’s unfair
I’ve been reminded how it feels to be again

I’ll do it again, I’ll fall right in
I’ll do it again, I’ll fall right in
I’ll do it again, I’ll fall right in
I’ll do it again, I’ll fall right in

I’ll do it again, I’ll fall right in
I’ll do it again, I’ll fall right in
I’ll do it again, I’ll fall right in

I’ll do it again, I’ll fall right in
I’ll do it again, I’ll fall right in
I’ll do it again, I’ll fall right in
