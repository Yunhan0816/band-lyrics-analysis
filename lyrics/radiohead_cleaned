When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us
Karma police, I've given all I can
It's not enough, I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Please, could you stop the noise
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices
In my head
What's that?
What's that?
When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all
What's that?
What's that?
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy
You don't remember
You don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man
Off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
That's it, sir, you're leaving 
The crackle of pigskin 
The dust and the screaming 
The yuppies networking 
The panic, the vomit 
The panic, the vomit 
God loves his children
God loves his children, yeah
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
Dreamers
They never learn
They never learn
Beyond the point
Of no return
Of no return
Then it's too late
The damage is done
The damage is done
This goes
Beyond me
Beyond you
A white room
By a window
Where the sun comes
Through
We are
Just happy to serve
Just happy to serve
You

Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round-up
This is a low-flying panic attack
Sing the song on the jukebox that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
Red crosses on wooden doors
If you float, you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers
This is a low flying panic attack
Sing the song of sixpence that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you live
A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the 80s
But gravity always wins
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears...
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time
I'm the next act
Waiting in the wings
I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car
I am all the days
That you choose to ignore
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
I'm a moth
Who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
Because there are no others
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
It's all wrong, it's all wrong, it's all wrong
It's all right,  it's all right,  it's all right
It's all wrong,  it's all right
It's all right,  it's all right
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be, oh, me, oh, me
The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all can
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all-
But now I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want
When I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create, that we can
Pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create
But when I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want
When I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know
Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape
Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose
Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone
Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill
Such a chill
And you can laugh a spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke
I’ll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I’ll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just don’t leave
Don’t leave
I’m not living
I’m just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile
Just don’t leave
Don’t leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
Just don’t leave
Don’t leave
Then into your life, there comes a darkness
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
And all we trapped rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
Into our darkest hour
But it was just a laugh, just a laugh
Just a laugh, just a laugh
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
A ten ton head, made of wet sand
Oh this dread circumference
You've gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, in the glass
It was just a laugh, just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
In split infinity
Then into your life, there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Into your darkest hour
When you've had enough of me
When you've had enough of me
Sweet darling
When you've had enough of me
When you've had enough of me
Sweet darling
Sweet times
Sweet darling
Sweet times
This dance, this dance
Is like a weapon, is like a weapon
Of self-defence, of self-defence
Against the present, against the present
The present tense
No, I won't get heavy, don't get heavy
Keep it light and keep it moving
I am doing no harm
As my world comes crashing down
I'll be dancing, freaking out
Deaf, dumb, and blind
In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost
I won't turn around or the penny drops
Won't stop now, won't slack off
Or all this love will be in vain
To stop from falling down a mine
It's no one's business but mine
Where all this love has been in vain
In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost
Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so, so disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Let down again
Let down again
Let down again
You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back
And one day
I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
If you could take it all back again
Strike up the tinderbox
Why should I be good if you're not?
This is a foul tasting medicine
A foul tasting medicine
To be trapped in your full stop
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up 
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up 
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up 
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up 
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up 
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up 
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up 
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up 
When you take me back
Take me back again
Will you take me back
Take me back again
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time
Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing you've had has gone away
So don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

There are two colours in my head
There are two colours in my head
What, what is that you tried to say?
What, what was that you tried to say?
Tried to say, tried to say
Tried to say, tried to say
Everything
Everything
Everything
It holds us like a phantom
It touches  like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See the moon is smiling
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
Cause we're not at the mercy
Of your chimeras and spells
Your chimeras and spells
Mmmhm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
One day at a time
We call upon the people
The people have this power
The numbers don't decide
The system is a lie
A river running dry
The wings of butterflies
And you may pour us away like soup
Like we're pretty broken flowers
We'll take back what is ours
Take back what is ours
One day at a time
Who's in a bunker? Who's in a bunker?
Women and children first
And the children first, and the children
I'll laugh until my head comes off
I'll swallow until I burst
Until I burst, until I
Who's in a bunker? Who's in a bunker?
I have seen too much
I haven't seen enough, you haven't seen it
I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first
And children first, and children
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Let me hear both sides
Let me hear both sides, let me hear both
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Throw it in the fire
Throw it in the fire, throw it on the
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening, happening
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening, happening
Mobiles skwerking, mobiles chirping
Take the money and run
Take the money and run, take the money
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed

Fitter, happier, more productive
Comfortable 
Regular exercise at the gym 
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well 
A patient, better driver
A safer car 
Sleeping well 
No paranoia
Careful to all animals 
Keep in contact with old friends 
Will frequently check credit at  bank 
Favours for favours
Fond but not in love
Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket
Car wash 
No longer afraid of the dark
Or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned 
An empowered and informed member of society 
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet 
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit 
Calm
Fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig
In a cage
On antibiotics
Reckoner
Can't take it with yer'
Dancing for your pleasure
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all human
All human beings
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
Because we separate 
Like ripples on a blank shore 
Reckoner
Take me with yer'
Dedicated to all human
All human beings
I won't run away no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise
Even when you lock me out
I promise
I say my prayers every night
I promise
I know which side I'm spread
I promise
The tantrums and the chitty chats
I promise
Even when the ship is wrecked
I promise
Tie me to the rotting deck
I promise
I won't run away no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise
Even when the ship is wrecked
I promise
Tie me to the rotting deck
I promise
I won't run away no more
I promise
That there, that's not me
I go where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone
And I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
Now as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light, born of a light
The wind rushing 'round my open heart
An open ravine with my spirit light
Totally alive and my spirit light
Through an open doorway
Across a street to another life
And catching my reflection in a window
Switching on a light, one I didn’t know
Totally alive, totally released
Waking, waking up from shutdown
From a thousand years of sleep
Yeah, you, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Standing on the edge of
Yeah, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Different types of love
Different types of love
Different types of love
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible
I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie
We've got heads on sticks
You've got ventriloquists
We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Lying in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
The rats and the children follow me out of town
Rats and children follow me out of town
Come on, kids
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me on to phantoms 
I follow to the edge 
Of the earth 
And fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves 
If they get the chance 
And this 
Is my chance
I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes
Yeah I
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape, escape
And I
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape, escape
In the next world war
In a jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again
In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe
In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls are bending shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance
Jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once, not just twice
Wish away the nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You've got the light you can feel it on your back
A light you can feel it on your back
Your jigsaw falling into place
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing
Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails
So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking
Hey it's me
I-I just got off the train
A frightening place
The faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?
Buy another ticket?
The panic is coming on strong
So cold, from the inside out
No great drama
Message coming in
In the oh-so-smug
Glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day
Where the path trails off
And heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush
I don't know where it leads
And I don't really care
Where the path trails off
And heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush
I don't know where it leads
And I don't really care
I feel this love to the core
I feel this love turn cold
