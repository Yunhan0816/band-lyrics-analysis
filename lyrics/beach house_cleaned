It was late at night
You held on tight
From an empty sea
A flash of light
It will take a while
To make you smile
Somewhere in these eyes
I’m on your side
You wide-eyed girls
You get it right
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Tender is the night
For a broken heart
Who will dry your eyes
When it falls apart?
What makes this fragile world go 'round?
Were you ever lost?
Was she ever found?
Somewhere in these eyes
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back in
Drifting in and out
You see the road you’re on
It came rolling down your cheek
You say just what you mean
And in between
It’s never as it seems
Help me to name it
Help me to name it
If you built yourself a myth
You'd know just what to give
What comes after this
Momentary bliss
The consequence
Of what you do to me
Help me to name it
Help me to name it
Found yourself in a new direction
Arrows falling from the sun
Canyon calling, would they come to greet you?
Let you know you’re not the only one
Can’t keep hangin' on
To what is dead and gone
If you built yourself a myth
You'd know just what to give
Materialize
Or let the ashes fly
Help me to name it
Help me to name it
Out in the heartland
I looked in your eyes
And I asked, "Are you ready
Ready for this life?"
Did you see it coming?
It happened so fast
The timing was perfect
Water on glass
Like tracing figure eights
On ice in skates, oh well
And if this ice should break
It would be my mistake
Between the cities
Between the thrills
There's something inside you
That doesn't sleep well
It won't last forever
Or maybe it will
The white clothes they gave you
You wear them so well
Someone once told me
In love, that you must
Place all you're given
In infinite trust
Yet I'm tracing figure eights
On ice in skates, so well
And if this ice should break
It would be my mistake
You and me with our long hair on the gold wall
After midnight we could feel it all
I'd go anywhere you want to
You should see there's a place I want to take you
When the train comes I will hold you
Cause you blow my mind
On the bridge levitating cause we want to
When the unknown will surround you
There is no right time
There is no right time
The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now
You will grow too quick
Then you will get over it
The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now
There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will surround you
There's a place I want to take you 
When they knocked on the door looking for you…
When the unknown will surround you 
As our bodies lift up slowly
There's a place I want to take you 
When they knocked on the door looking for you…
When the unknown will surround you 
As our bodies lift up slowly
There's a place I want to take you
You always go to the parties
To pluck the feathers off all the birds
On your knees
I would not beg you, please
I want your picture but not your words
You know they’d want it, but there's no first
On your own
But you cannot call it your home
We always rub our hands too much
We know the reasons, but such and such
On your own
You will not catch your own bone
We run our fingers together
You know it's easy
The devil's plan
On your own
You cannot call me your own
Jack of all trades
Master of none
Cry all the time
Cause I'm not having fun
You always want to be forgiven
The devil does what you ask of him
On your knees
You cannot; You are not for free
Beyond love
The first thing that I do before I get into your house
I'm gonna tear off all the petals
From the rose that's in your mouth
Beyond love
You wanted to find Elvis and I didn't understand
They take the simple things inside you
And put nightmares in your hands
Beyond love
This man comes to me
Heartbreak did this
He was made to believe
That he should live without it
All I know's what I see
No change in this
Visions born in the dreams
Of a world left without it
We really wanna know
We really do agree
We really do agree
We really wanna know
The last thing that she sees before they turn off all the lights
Was there, a man up in the corner with the spiders made of light
We really wanna know
Beyond love
All I know is what I see and I can't live without this
Could you ever believe beyond love?
I really wanna know
I really wanna know
We drive around this town
Houses melting down
A vision turning green
Is all we've ever seen
And then it's dark again
A new development
Wishing that it meant
Something natural
Don't we know it's cruel
And it goes dark again
Just like a spark
Hallucination comes
Think of everyone
That never shared before
From my mouth to yours
And then it's dark again
Just like a spark
And then it vanishes
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark
And then we're vanishing
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark
You go to school, you follow all the rules, you live inside
Realize there's something in your eyes, you're back again
From the spine rising through the mind, you give it up
It's a gift taken from the lips, you live again
Make it
Wave it
Alive
Make it
Wave it
Alive
Stand beside it
We can't hide the way
You make us glow
It's no good unless
It grows
Feel this burning, love of mine
Deep inside the ever spinning
Tell me, does it feel?
It's no good unless it's real
Hillsides burning
Wild-eyed turning
'til we're running from it
I'd take care of you
If you'd ask me to
In a year or two
You say swimming in the lake
We'll come across a snake
It is real and then it's fake
Feel its heartbeat
Feel what you heat
Far so fast
It feels too late
I'd take care of you
If you'd ask me to
In a year or two
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
Read my fortune too
Tell me what you see
Cross it like a T
It's all the same to me
This game I play
I do it every day
Then promise I'll be fine
Bear it every time
When you turn the lights down low
Lemon color, honey glow
See this state I'm in
Is crawling in my skin
Fevers took me back
And turned me inside out
When you turn the lights down low
Lemon color, honey glow
It's what you do
This pulls me through
To the other end
Where it begins
You see through me
Still, it's coming back
I come alive
You stay all night
You feel it coming right through you
The color of your mind
The color of your mind
The color of your mind
You feel it coming right through you
It's on the other side
It doesn't have to be this way
The color of your mind
It's what you do
This pulls me through
I come alive
You stay all night
It's what you do
This pulls me through
I come alive
You stay all night
Candy-colored misery
The color of your mind
Gather matters of the heart
So we can act a fool
It's incomplete without you
The silver soul is running through
It's a vision, complete illusion, yeah
The needle on the spinning wheel
Collecting silver coil
It gathers heat without you
Whether or not you're turned from it
It's a quick turn, to let us in, yeah
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
The bodies lying in the sand
They're moving in the dark
It is so quick to let us in
Feel it moving through our skin
It's a sickness, infinite quickness, yeah
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
No better color
Looked everywhere
We're driving home every night
The shadows stay by your side
You built a city
All in your head
Triangle of ever light
It turns you on every night
Need a companion
A hidden prayer
You know you're not losing your mind
What’s left you make something of it
The sky and what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Baby I'm yours
No better color
Look everywhere
You built a city
All in your head
You know you're not losing your mind
What’s left you make something of it
The sky and what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Wildflower
No one could find you
Out on your own
All things I loved
But do not know
On Hopewell Road
These days of candy
Live in your mind
Those violet lines
White fenced in miles
Across my eyes
A world inside you
No photograph
My natural one
The rising sun
Live in your mind
Just like that, it's gone
Just like that, it's gone
Just like that
I know it comes too soon
The universe is riding off with you
Hi o, out there, I know
A little bit of you I keep it close to me
I know it comes too soon
The universe is riding on with you
I know it comes too soon
I know it stays for nobody
I want to know you there
The universe is riding off with you
Can't help seeking corners
Of dark and dead end rooms
Where the drinks keep pouring down
And the candles keep me warm
Isolation tenders
Something fragile coming soon
Skinny angels making eyes at cameras
Perched in every room
I had a good run playing horses in my mind
Left my heart out somewhere running
Wanting strangers to be mine
Memory's a sacred meat
That's drying all the time
On a hillside I remember
I am loving losing life
Strawberries in springtime
Pretty happy accidents
My awareness that I'm lucky
Rolling clouds over cement
Maybe there's a screenplay
Or a bathroom I can hide
Down the hallways of a high school
And the dances left behind
I had a good run playing horses in my mind
Left my heart out somewhere running
Wanting strangers to be mine
I would climb the Eiffel Tower
Write letters on the sky
How many turns it took to reach you
I had a good run playing horses in my mind
On a hillside I remember
I am loving losing life
You know you're gold
You don't got to worry none
Oasis child
Born and so wild
Don't I know you
Better than the rest?
All deception
All deception from you
Your love is stag
In the white sand
Wilderness for miles
Eyes so mild and wise
Don't I know you
Better than the rest?
All deception
All deception from you
Anyway you run
You run before us
Black and white horse
Arching among us
Anyway you run
You run before us
Black and white horse
Arching among us
Your love is stag
In the white sand
Oasis child
Born into a man
Don't I know you
Better than the rest?
All deception
All deception from you
Wilderness for miles
Eyes so mild and wise
Oasis child
Born and so wild
Don't I know you
Better than the rest?
All deception
All deception from you
Anyway you run
You run before us
Black and white horse
Arching among us
Anyway you run
You run before us
Black and white horse
Arching among us
Anyway you run
You run before us
Black and white horse
Arching among us
Anyway you run
You run before us
Black and white horse
Arching among us
In the blue of this life
Where it ends in the night
When you couldn’t see
You would come for me
Wonder eyes, motion high
And we don’t dare slip on by
Make us suffer
Like no other
Is nothing like lapis lazuli
Let it go back to me
Like no other you can’t be replaced
Like no other you can’t be replaced
Like no other you can’t be replaced
Like no other you can’t be replaced
Like no other you can’t be replaced
Like no other you can’t be replaced
Like no other you can’t be replaced
Like no other you can’t be replaced
Is nothing like lapis lazuli
Like no other you can’t be replaced
Is nothing like lapis lazuli
Like no other you can’t be replaced
Is nothing like lapis lazuli
Like no other you can’t be replaced
Is nothing like lapis lazuli
Like no other you can’t be replaced
Is nothing like lapis lazuli
Like no other you can’t be replaced
Is nothing like lapis lazuli
Chances are
Like night you’ll disappear
Caught in the atmosphere
Where you go
She casts no shadow
Still you know she's near
L–
Here she comes
All parts of everything
Stars in the motherhand
With the dark thunder
Above you
Come to us soaring
L–a–i–
Chances are
10:37
House made of the dawn
Disappears
You go for a walk in the park
'Cause you don't need
Anything
The hand that you sometimes hold
Doesn't do anything
The face that you see in the door
Isn't standing there anymore
In a matter of time
It will slip from my mind
In and out of my life
You would slip from my mind
In a matter of time
The face that you saw in the door
Isn't looking at you anymore
The name that you call in its place
Isn't waiting
For your embrace
The world that you love to behold
Cannot hold you
Anymore
In a matter of time
It will slip from my mind
In and out of my life
You would slip from my mind
In a matter of time
More, you want more
More, you want more
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
Light that comes up
On the ceiling
My mouth
And these arms
Hold the feeling
Even I
Can't control
My nature
If they should come up much before you
I would not ever
Try to capture you
Bluebird, where you gonna go now?
Lead me to
The gallows
Where out
Corner my eye
There's something
It's pulling me back from nothing
From nothing
If they should come up much before you
I would not ever
Try to capture you
Bluebird, where you gonna go now?
Scenes change
Before they are over
Before they are over
Seven girls
Seven girls at the end of day
She who sings
She who prays
Side by side
In a line
See their eyes
Eyes that show
Eyes that show what's you
True today
Seven ways
Eyes that shine
Silent skies
Show a way
What is you
Where is she today
Saw my girl
From within
She who sways
She who spins
Seventh girl
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept
Toutes les filles ne sont pas prêtes
Vers l'eglise et vers la Seine
Toute leurs cœurs et toute leur peine
Petit ange et l'inconnue
Sainte, la pute et l'ingénue
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept
Toutes les filles ne sont pas prêtes
Little girl, you could be loved
Little girl, you should be loved
The moment you say you know
Is the moment you are
Little girl, you could be loved
Little girl, you should be loved
The moment you say you know
Is the moment you are
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept
Toutes les filles ne sont pas prêtes
Vers l'eglise et vers la Seine
Toute leurs cœurs et toute leur peine
Petit ange et l'inconnue
Sainte, la pute et l'ingénue
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept
Toutes les filles ne sont pas prêtes
You had one job!
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
She's just my type
Dark hair, wavin’ out the passenger side
Then I start to think
As she pulls me on the bathroom floor
This is my type of thing, yeah yeah
Oh, darling of mine, where have you been?
I feel so alive with you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine
Oh, darling of mine
On a train through Japan
I keep her real close 'cause she knows who I am
Red pill in my hand
Paranoid cutie with a dark past, and
It’s that type of thing
When she feels like the girl next door
This is my type of thing, yeah yeah
Oh, darling of mine, where have you been?
I feel so alive with you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine
Oh, darling of mine
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
And then I start to think as I lift her on the sink
That I've been here before
It's a certain type of fling, she gets bored of everything
Not the type you can ignore
Yeah, I just want a taste as she grabs me by the waist
As she closes the door
She's taking what she wants, baby, you can have it all
Oh, darling of mine, where have you been? 
I feel so alive with you in my bed 
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go 
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Oh, darling of mine
I met you
Somewhere
In a hell
Beneath the stairs
There's someone in that room
That frightens you
When they go boom
Boom, boom, boom
The color you say is black
Is the one you might lack
In the size of your eyes
Is there a
Righteous prize?
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I met you, I met you
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh
There's something wrong
With our hearts
When they beat pure
They stand apart
In the black room, the light
Watch the seabird fall
Real love
It finds you
Somewhere with your back to it
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I met you, I met you
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh
We know, we know
We belong
By the street
And to the dawn
We know, we know
We belong
By the street
And to the dawn
We know, we know
We belong
By the street
And to the dawn
We know, we know
We belong
By the street
And to the dawn
Pink and blue were dancing
Empty floor, shadows lancing
Somewhere in a ballroom tonight
Red and blue combination
Old man finds elation
Somewhere in a ballroom tonight
Love me, see what I see tonight
Let us find elation
Somewhere in a ballroom tonight
Nowhere on an ordinary night
She's so lovely
Everything about her
Mannerisms of another
Castles in the sand
Money in your hand
And all I have to do
Is everything for you
From the way that her eyes are shaped
And it's making me sick
With her head on my shoulder
Waking up baby just to believe
For her dinner
Baby pink lavender
Leather white umbrella sinner
She's so lovely
Everything about her
Mannerisms of another
She's so lovely
Everything about her
Mannerisms of another
Castles in the sand
Money in your hand
And all I have to do
Is stay away from you
You hear my cry
Lover of mine
No tear in the eye
Or fear in my mind
The forest is thick
And we don't recognize
We parted our lips
And we reached from inside
In a wide open field
We know we can feel
Awake and unreal
Off to nowhere
Off to nowhere
Off to nowhere
Need more people
To be satisfied
With no fear of a god
And a prayer for the night
You come into our minds
And rush through our lives
We parted our lips
And reached from inside
In a wide open field
We know we can feel
Awake and unreal
Off to nowhere
Off to nowhere
Off to nowhere
The only thing you've got
You know
You're better off without it
Youngest fire
You decide
You decide
What is right
Youngest fire
Who decide
We decide
What is right
Near yet so far
Isn't it?
You are coming home
Are you still alone?
Are you not the same as you
Used to be?
As the sun grows high
And you serve your time
Does each day just feel like
Another lie?
Now you know
Is it just for show?
Just a foolish game
That you hide behind?
Don't forget the nights
When it all felt right
Are you not the same
As you used to be?
Used to be
Used to be
In an endless night
Could you feel the fright
Of an age that was
And could never be?
So we hold it close
When we feel the most
Like a love that we could not
Leave behind
Turn the wheel
To each way we feel
'Til I'm lost and I cannot
Find you there
Don't forget the nights
When it all felt right
Are you not the same as you
Used to be?
Used to be
Used to be
Coming home any day now
Any day now, any day now
Coming home any day now
Any day now, any day now
Coming home any day now
Any day now, any day now
Pay no mind
It takes time
What's that you say
Down the hall
I heard a song
Who knows
Drifting away
Baby at night when I look at you
Nothing in this world keeps me confused
All it takes, look in your eyes
All of me
Is to tow the waste
What's that you say
It's going away
It's painful but
You do what you must
Takes time to know
Baby at night when I look at you
Nothing in this world keeps me confused
All it takes, look in your eyes
Who knows if there're roses in heaven
Let go of that empty feeling
Not dumber just a little bit older
Kiss of love couldn't be much colder
Dark red light years
Brought near
Cold gone glowing
Night sing
Star death ringing
Brought fear
I want to lie in
They call Orion
The colors missing
Upon the dark spring
Cold red light years
Brought near
Dark gone glowing
Night sing
The worlds colliding
Unreal dividing
The colors missing
Upon the dark spring
My mother said to me
That I would get in trouble
Our father won't come home
'Cause he is seeing double
Out in the endless green
Your eyes are so misleading
That's when your car pulls up
Its hood is black and gleaming
And in a while
You start to smile
The earth is wild
You've got no time
Wild in our ways
What we are making
Heartless to say
Go on pretending
Wild in our ways
What we are making
Heartless to say
You go, go on pretending
One chance to fall behind
The lines that would not let you
Can I believe in how
The past is what will catch you?
And in a while
You start to smile
The earth is wild
You've got no time
Wild in our ways
What we are making
Heartless to say
Go on pretending
Wild in our ways
What we are making
Heartless to say
We go, go on pretending
Wild in our ways
Go on pretending
The heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw
Put your hand on this stone, it's the stone of a home you know
They say we will go far, but they don't know how far we'll go
With our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon
They say we can throw far but they don't know how far we throw
With our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon
The heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw
They say we will go far, but they don't know how far we'll go
It can't be gone, we're still right here
It took so long, can't say we heard it all
Limbs parallel, we stood so long we fell
Tear a moment from the days
That carry us on forever
This push and pull is the force of a wave of time
In the heat of the night, we would cry, you are not mine
They said we would go far, but they don't know how far we'd go
'Cause this heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw
It can't be gone
We're still right here
It took so long
Can't say we saw it all
Limbs parallel
We stood so long we fell
Bright pyramids at night
That carry us on forever
It can't be gone
We're still right here
It took so long
Can't say we felt it all
Limbs parallel
We stood so long we fell
Love's like a pantheon
It carries on forever
Outside looking in
Mirrors once again
Nothing left to say
Tomorrow's gone today
Lose your smile
Lose your smile
Sweet lies on your face
Tears are out of place
Sunshine in the rain
Comes in rainbows and leaves again
Lose your smile
Lose your smile
When all the while, child
It's your own self giving in
Who's to blame this time?
Lose your smile
Lose your smile
Dreams, baby, do come true
Dreams, baby, do come true
Dreams, baby, do come true
Dreams, baby, do come true
