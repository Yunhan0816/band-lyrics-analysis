[Verse 1]
Shots ringing out, I'm soaking
Eardrums shaking, years start weighin' me down
Crawling out from a spiral down
Fixing now to mix the white and brown
Passing out, running in place
You're the sun and I'm your cloud
Burning down, running in place
Got so high I finally felt like myself

[Verse 2]
Shots wringing out, I'm soaking
Eardrums shaking, years start weighing me down
Buried deep in a heroine sleep
Floating deeper underground
Passing out, running in place
You're the sun and I was your cloud
Burning out, running in place
Got so high I finally felt like myself

[Bridge]
Would you give your 81st year
For a glimpse of heaven, now and here?
Would you give your 60th year
For a glimpse of heaven, now and here?
Would you give your 45th year
For a glimpse of heaven, now and here?
Would you give your 34th year
For a glimpse of heaven, now and here?

[Verse 3]
Shots ringing out, I'm soaking
Eardrums shaking, years started weighing me down
Crawling out from a spiral down
Fixing now to mix the white and brown
Passing out, running in place
You're the sun and I am your cloud
Burning down, running in place
Got so high I finally felt like myself

[Verse 4]
Shots wringing out, I'm soaking
Eardrums shaking, years start weighing me down
Buried deep in a heroine sleep
Floating deeper underground
Passing out, running in place
You're the sun and I'm your cloud
Burning out, running in place
Got so high I finally felt like myself



[Verse 1]
I saw you with a very loose grip on your tight ship
And I left you with a very big mess then I watched it progress
Took a little time for your trip but I saw you starting to slip
And you always kept your eyes on any little hiding spot that you had forgot
And I saw you after a decent spell in a private hell
And I told you, "I hope I live a thousand lives, hope I live them well"
Fought my mind to keep my life, but my body’s putting up a tougher fight
Yeah if it feels wrong, you can go on along
But once it feels right then you just lost the fight

[Verse 2]
I saw you with a very loose grip on your tight ship
And I lost you when you said one hit couldn’t hurt a bit
Took a little time for your trip but I saw you starting to slip
Cause you always kept your eyes on any little hiding spot that you had forgot
I can’t shake the terror of my life fleeting, minute by minute
Even when I can’t imagine another day waking up in it
Fought my mind to keep my life, but my body’s putting up a tougher fight
Yeah if it feels wrong, you can go on along
But once it feels right then you just lost the fight



Yes, I'll come back to you
No, I won't ask where you run
Under the sun

Yes, I'll catch up to you
Then I'll ask, "what have we done?"
Under the sun

To be free, be awake
Big breath that you can’t fake
Once you’ve begun

Press my face to the back
All the pillars that stack
And hold up the sun

On the right side coming on the right time
On the right time coming on the right side
(x4)



How could i describe
This fading dream?
You turned and looked a way
It goes around getting louder now
Believe it
Freezes love that way

Name the song and I’ll
Just scream it
There’s a
Dead moon in my head
It claws the ground both lost and found
And fleeting
To crash into again

——

How could i describe
A long lost dream?
You turned and looked a way
I’ve lived ten lives and had ten loves
To remind me
What I’ve been guilty of

Say the song and I’ll
Just scream
It there’s a
Fucked moon in my head
It claws the ground both lost and found
And fleeing
From the healthy moon



The right side of me
Is the right side of me
Burn it down and give it up
You never wanna give it up

Medicine for free
If you’d only asked for me
I’d be a better animal
In every other little way

Stuck inside of me
In tragedy i’m complete
Mother father daughter son
My Valentine my only one

Keep me in distant sight
Of when it's day and when it's night
And how many weeks have passed
And if I'm still who i was last



Never had you run so far but you really gotta get away
You know it in the nighttime running to it
Caught a rising star but then you let it drop into
The ocean now the water's running through it
Now you've gone so far you really had to get away
You knew it in your lifetime, running to it
Acting like you've come so far the bed you made yourself
And this house and me are all falling apart

Never thought you'd go so far but now you're really
Gone and it's been so long I never really think about it
Yeah you made a beating heart, whatever, now that amber
Light has faded and it's yours to commit to it
Act like it stops and starts, a gesture here and there
For me is one thing but I felt it every time you blew it
Now you've gone too far your urge to run away is back and we all know



How long have you known?
How long has it shown?
Forever, forever, forever, if ever

How long have you known?
How long has it shown?
Forever, if ever, forever, if ever

How long?

How long have you known?
How long has it shown?
Forever, if ever, forever, if ever

How long have you known?
How long has it shown?
Forever, if ever, forever, if ever

How long?



You ain't the first to realize
You ain't the first to look in my eyes

Over my head and positive
I have a gift that i’ll never give

You ain't the first
You ain't the first

Last time i walked down this street
I walked down this street
I wanted to die

Die

Now i’m fighting
I feel like i’m fighting
I feel like i’m
Fighting for my life

Life



Take your time, hear em out
How they went to go about to give it up and find yourself in time
Take your time, it’s all about
The circle up to circle out what’s in your mind, then take yr time

Take your time, come about
Draw your flag and hand it out, then take a look and then hide it deep inside
Take your time, hear em out
It works if you work it out, to clean out your mind, and take yr time



Yeah out of sight
And out of mind
But everything I should do
Just comes so easily to you

You had me first
Our shadow thirst
When roles reverse
My mind rewinds and i see you

I’m out of signs
At the end of the line
But I’ll be fine
When it’s time I’ll know what to do

The world was mine
But I’m too blind
I’ll stay behind
And choose which scrap to start anew

—

I’m out of sight, I’m out of mind
Out like a light, and left behind



There’s a crack
Reflective grass
Stone face
Mute glance
High black
In the back of
A normal joke
Easier to choke
Smile glue
Bad stick/bad fit
With you
A blanket curse
A made up bed that waits
In heaven
You have my face
My neck my waist
And a fucking saint
In a rocking chair
That stays in place
Thief for a chance
Kiss for a catch
Blue flower
Blue boredom !
Did you know I colored in the clues
For you for you
They make a game
That spells your name
Fresh fear at the centerfold
Colored mess to backwards steps
Always taste
Like another face
Always smell
Like a kind of hell
Waterproof person to be
To be
Blood like soap
When water washes it thin
Washes it away to stay



[Verse 1]
The only way to be quiet is to be quick
A slow death rite like an innocent fight
Left me choked and white in a patch of light
Feeling like a wick wax drowned and bright
Burned skin like a string black ashes slight
I know I gotta kick but I can’t get sick
I’ll hold you here tight, keep you overnight
And it gets too bright, and your body’s a brick
Keep outta sight while my watch just ticks
I’m trying to keep quiet but I can’t move quick
Drowning in air, light, floating up in flight
Then it gets too bright, and your body’s a brick
You fall

[Verse 2]
I forced myself to be quiet just to be quick
Lead a slow death rite like an innocent fight
Left me choked and white in a patch of light
Feeling like a wick wax drowned and bright
Burned skin like a string black ashes slight
I know I gotta kick but I can’t get sick
I’ll hold you here tight, keep you overnight
And it gets too bright, and your body’s a brick
But now I’m fucked to die in a world of shit
I’m trying to keep quiet but I can’t move quick
Wings matted with death spilled oil slick
Then it gets too bright, and your body’s a brick
And you fall



Anything we should know about your change?
Bleached black from the smile
On a glimpse of your face
Yeah I ran to her
Blame it on me
That inevitable date
You remember her

I'm putting it off
And I can't control fate
Cause we're similar
I blame it on you
Cause that side of me I hate
But you were never hurt

I'm putting it off
And I can't control fate
Yeah I ran to her
Blame it on me
That inevitable game
But you were never hurt



Sunrise waiting
I knew myself completely then nothing I thought it hasn't said but
Youth light fading
I know myself as I was then birds sounding each shorter day in
Sun tries vainly
To stay lit for another day melts into darkness static state
Til young light waves in
Drink the heat and climb and twist fawn looking for a friend to kiss



On yr own/Yr not far



If I'm alone and you're free now
We know nothing's ever meant to be
But come along with me
And by my secret side that no one sees
I built a throne from a burden of need
Earth boy gets harvested or else recedes
So while you're cold Numb my dream
And I'll chew rocks and splinters sob and scream
Earth boy,.
Earth boy,.
Earth boy,.
You sit alone,.



I was blind, but now I see
You made a believer out of me

I was blind, but now I see
You made a river out of me

I was blind, but now I see
You made a believer out of me

I was high, but now I feel low
My own private I dunno



Its today and its in a word
I breathe and seethe
Fade to zero
I’m misinformed
I’m barely born
Gone to the void
With the incarnate devil and a talking snake

"here in this spring storm, stars float along the void…"

Here he comes
Today
Its written on my face
A clue
A tunnel you can look right through
It’ll take
Some time in line
With the incarnate devil
And a talking snake



Innocent and late for love
In your city
Weights above
Innocent and late for love
In a city
I'd wait so long
To feel you feel you
Here alone, yeah
I'll seep into your bones and
Innocently wait for love...



All our loose ends
Are gathered here inside this house
You left me here to sort them out

But its not all yours really
I kept a few to hold onto
I tied them to my wrists and you said:

"does it feel watered down?"
"does it feel over now?"

"do you feel watered down?"
"do you feel older now?"

You hated when i said
I needed anything, i didn't
So i walked into your room
And took it all



It's no good it would be a waste of breath to tell a man who believes in me that he's got something better to do

It's no good it would be a waste of breath to tell a man that he's got something better to do

----

It's no good it would be a waste of breath to tell the man in me that he’s got something better to do

It's no good it would be a waste of breath to tell a man that he's got something better to do



Oh your body is a mess sometimes
Your brain is just a part of your head
It really is a mess sometimes
Your head is just a part of the rest

It's really necessary sometimes
Your birth is just a part of your death
That really isn't it this time
Your death is just a part of your

[Repeats]



I was your home and you locked yourself outside
And run with your ghosts
Back to a place you'd already known

Nowhere to crawl but to your past life
And hide from it all
A buried flower convinced you'll grow

Kept enough to remind but stayed outside
With nowhere to go
You left nowhere to go



[Verse 1]
Uh fuck the world
Alien love
Pull me out
In your flood
Uh fuck the world
Alien love
Pull me out
In your flood

[Verse 2]
Ah I let it rain
Drink from cup
Maybe raze
Pray for flood
Oshin crash
Salt makes blood
Red with clay
Black with mud
Fuck the world
Alien love



You'll never have a home
You'll never have a home
You'll never have a home until you go home
You'll never have a home
You'll never have a home
You'll never have a home until you go home



Choke-clean cold to cool my thoughts away
Choke-clean cold to cool my thoughts away from you



[Instrumental]



You will rise [?]
You rise [?]
You'll rise [?]
You're alright [?]
You were right [?]
You rise [?]
You will rise [?]

(repeated, assorted)



[Instrumental]



One afterthought on a skin game
"I took it as prescribed"
Vow do no harm, buy the cure
But first you'll buy the disease

I can see you've had some struggles lately
Hey man I've had mine too

Fighting to get through the door
But I can't live like this anymore
They gave us wings to fly
But then they took away the sky

Well, what you want?
"Serve me."
Sell me to the spoon
I'm cashing in, falling out, hung me up
Strung out to please the king in metropolitan's Sackler wing
I can help you it's how I help myself

I can see you've had some struggles lately
Hey man I've had mine too

Fighting to get through the door
But I can't live like this anymore
They gave us wings to fly
But then they took away the sky

I wanna be your doll
But I won't be your dog anymore
You gave us wings to fly
But then you took away the sky

Sunken ceiling and a sideways grin
We live to use and we use to live
Crack a window
Get some life in you

Holding in coughs, hiding my head
"Everyone respects the dead"
I can help you it's how I help myself

Sunken ceiling and a sideways grin
We live to use and we use to live
Crack a window
Get some life in me
